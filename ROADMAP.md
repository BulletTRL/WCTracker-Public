# Roadmap

This is a lightweight roadmap based on current plans and beta feedback. Priorities can shift.

## Recently Completed
- Hideout upgrades view (data + UI)
- Track FIR-required hideout items
- Achievement searching
- Quest reward item tracking (surface items you will receive from quests)
- PvE vs PvP split view
- Update notifier tied to public GitHub Releases (auto-install pending code signing)
- Removed BTR from onboarding auto-complete logic
- Hideout downgrade control (per-level, with edition-based guardrails)
- Hide quest tree edit button in the UI (keep layout data)
- Onboarding auto-complete now skips assumption logic under level 15
- Hideout requirements/rewards sections with collapsible lists, columns, and tooltips
- Show crafts unlocked by hideout upgrades without flooding the screen
- Dashboard start page (map-based recommendations + item needs panels)

## Active (Soon)
- Finish Discord setup and support flow
- Add back the defective wall as pre-req to other upgrades

## Backlog
- Website for beta access + whitelist application
- Sectioned quest completion (partial progress per task)
- All Items view (search item, see requirements, rewards, barters, hideout use, and description)
- PvE/PvP-specific quest and achievement variants
- Recommendation tuning and usability polish
- Quest tree focus mode (hide unrelated quests, highlight prereqs/unlocks across traders)
- Signed auto-updates (code signing)

## Long Term
- Map-based loot key guide (click key to see possible loot)
- Barter items tab
- PvP prestige flow (hide prestige quests until the next threshold)
- Additional onboarding improvements and mid-wipe start support
- Performance and packaging optimizations

If you want to suggest a priority, open an issue or post feedback with details.
