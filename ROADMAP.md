# Roadmap

This is a lightweight roadmap based on current plans and beta feedback. Priorities can shift.

## Now
- Hideout upgrades view (data + UI)
- Track FIR-required hideout items
- Finish in-progress feature polish and data sync

## Next
- Achievement searching
- Quest reward item tracking (surface items you will receive from quests)
- Dashboard start page (loading view)
- PvE vs PvP split view
- PvE/PvP-specific quest and achievement variants
- Sectioned quest completion (partial progress per task)
- All Items view (search item, see requirements, rewards, barters, hideout use, and description)
- Recommendation tuning and usability polish

## Later
- Map-based loot key guide (click key to see possible loot)
- Barter items tab
- PvP prestige flow (hide prestige quests until the next threshold)
- Updater system with safe interval checks
- Additional onboarding improvements and mid-wipe start support
- Performance and packaging optimizations

If you want to suggest a priority, open an issue or post feedback with details.
