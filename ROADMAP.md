# Roadmap

This is a lightweight roadmap based on current plans and beta feedback. Priorities can shift.

## Active (Soon)
- Finish Discord setup and support flow
- Add back the defective wall as pre-req to other upgrades

## Backlog
- Website for beta access + whitelist application
- All Items view (search item, see requirements, rewards, barters, hideout use, and description)
- Signed auto-updates (code signing)

## Long Term
- Map-based loot key guide (click key to see possible loot)
- Barter items tab
- PvP prestige flow (hide prestige quests until the next threshold)
- Additional onboarding improvements and mid-wipe start support
- Performance and packaging optimizations

If you want to suggest a priority, open an issue or post feedback with details.
