# Roadmap

This is a lightweight roadmap based on current plans and beta feedback. Priorities can shift.

## Active (Soon)
- All Items view (search item, see requirements, rewards, barters, hideout use, and description)
- Overlay for displaying item requirements
- In-raid overlay toggle (Ctrl+Shift+O) with a full interactive view for single-monitor users
- Debounced save pipeline with forced flush on close and critical actions
- PvP prestige flow (hide prestige quests until the next threshold)

## Backlog
- Server sided login for non-beta prevention
- Website for beta access + whitelist application
- Auto-rotating data backups (5-slot history with version/date metadata) plus restore/export selection UI
- Safeguards for irreversible actions (confirmation/undo + restore path for resets and quest path changes)
- Quest tree grid + camera correctness pass (snap/offset/clamp cleanup to keep alignment polished)
- Quest tree render performance pass (address large render warnings seen in the console)

## Long Term
- Map-based loot key guide (click key to see possible loot)
- Barter items tab
- Additional onboarding improvements and mid-wipe start support
- Performance and packaging optimizations

If you want to suggest a priority, open an issue or post feedback with details.
