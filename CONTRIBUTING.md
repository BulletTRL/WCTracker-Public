# Contributing

Thanks for the interest. WC Tracker is in active development.

## Current policy
- Issues: welcome (clear repro steps and screenshots help a lot).

## Development quickstart
- npm install
- npm start
- npm test

## Data edits
- Quest data lives under data/quests/ and is grouped by trader.
- Item catalog data lives under data/items/.
- User overrides go under user/ and should not be committed.

If you want to help with data cleanup or missing quests, open an issue with sources and evidence.
