# Contributing

Thanks for the interest. WC Tracker is in active development.

## Current policy
- Issues: welcome (clear repro steps and screenshots help a lot).

## Development quickstart
- npm install
- npm start
- npm test

## Data edits
- Quest data lives under data/quests/ and is grouped by trader.
- Item catalog data lives under data/items/.
- User overrides go under user/ and should not be committed.

If you want to help with data cleanup or missing quests, open an issue with sources and evidence.
We are looking for dedicated developers to help with feature additions and bug fixes. If you are interested in helping out feel free to shoot Bullet a message on discord with your experience.
